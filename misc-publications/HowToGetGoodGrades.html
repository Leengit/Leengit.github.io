<h1>How to Get Good Grades</h1>

<h3>What is important when taking a class?</h3>


<table border="1" width="100%">
<tr><th valign="top">Getting Good Grades</th>
    <td valign="top">This is your ticket to getting into the next class,
        the next school, or your first job.</td></tr>
<tr><th valign="top">Learning the facts</th>
    <td valign="top">If you learn the material enough to do well on
	exams this is your ticket to surviving in the next class, or
	retaining the next job.  If you get good grades but do not
	learn the facts, keeping that first job will be tough.</td></tr>
<tr><th valign="top">Learning to solve the problems</th>
    <td valign="top">If you learn the material enough to do well on the
	problem sets this is your ticket for advancing past that entry
	level job you get.  If you memorize the facts but do not learn
	how build upon them you may find yourself stuck in that first
	job, with no prospects for advancement.</td></tr>
<tr><th valign="top">Yearning for the topic</th>
    <td valign="top">If you want to be the top in your field, you must
	not only know the material and be able to manipulate it, you
	must enjoy it.  Entrepreneurs who are driven are one crucial
	step closer to success!</td></tr>
</table>

<p>Instead of finding the easiest way to get a good grade, try to find
the parts of the topic that are most interesting to you, and use
those to motivate you.  Some motivation, coupled with some decent
effort on the homework will get you the good grades you want
<em>and</em> the real skills you need.</p>

for their money." (Sometimes attributed to Woody Allen.)<br/>
