<h1>How To Make Money in Investments</h1>
<p>Some approaches work.&nbsp; Some approaches do not work.</p>
<h2>Strategies that beat the market</h2>
<ol>
<li><strong>Research, research, research:</strong> If you have the time, the inclination, and enough capital then you can make money by researching companies and investing accordingly.&nbsp; Is there a new product that you think is underrated or overrated; do the balance sheets not reflect the current reality in a way that the market does not yet understand; etc.?&nbsp; This is the only possible way to beat the markets.&nbsp; <strong>However</strong>, be aware that transaction costs for investors with less than about $500 thousand of capital (2015 dollars) can wipe out (and then some) any advantages this approach might have.&nbsp; The transaction costs from typically holding positions for less than a year can also wipe out the advanatages.</li>
</ol>
<h2>Strategies that meet the market</h2>
<ol>
<li><strong>Indexing:</strong> If you aren't going to try to beat the markets, your goal is to equal them.&nbsp; This is best achieved by buying and holding low-expense, index-based mutual funds or exchange-traded funds.&nbsp; Your choice of which funds is dictated only by their expense ratios and by your level of risk &mdash; how soon until you plan to retire, etc.?&nbsp; <strong>For most investors this is, by far, the best approach.</strong></li>
</ol>
<h2>Strategies that lag the market</h2>
<ol>
<li><strong>Go random:</strong> Choose companies by throwing darts at a board and buy shares of their stock using a discount broker.&nbsp; You will get more volatility (ups and downs) and more transaction costs than with indexing, but on average you expect to do only a little worse than average.&nbsp; Well, if you typically hold positions less than a year, the expenses will kill you and you will do significantly worse than average.</li>
<li><strong>Technical analysis:</strong> The stock just hit a three-month low, so I am buying, etc.&nbsp; If ever there was a time that this worked, it does not work any more because of the billion-dollar players who make microsecond-speed transactions to capture any profit.&nbsp; At present this is no better than the random approach; see above.</li>
<li><strong>Actively managed funds:</strong> If you didn't have to pay the manager, these could beat the markets, but you do have to pay the manager.&nbsp; The manager wins but you do not.&nbsp; Do not believe the hype about some managers consistently beating the market.&nbsp; There are a number of reasons why this appears to be so.&nbsp; Closing down the funds that lagged the market but not closing the ones that beat the market is one way to manufacture a good present-day portfolio.&nbsp; There are other ways too.</li>
<li><strong>Trending:</strong> Your neighbor, sibling, or aunt's best friend says that gold (or mortgage-backed securities or whatever) has only gone up, up, up (or down, down, down) this past few months and that it is now headed for the sky.&nbsp; Run, do not walk, away from these opportunities.</li>
